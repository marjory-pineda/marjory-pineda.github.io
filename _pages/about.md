## Biography

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Human-Centered Computing (HCC) Program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). I received my M.S. in Human-Centered Computing in 2024 and my B.A. in Business Technology Administration in 2022, both from UMBC.  

My research interests focus on **community-engaged work**, **human-centered AI**, and **accessibility**. Overall, I seek to understand and uncover the ways technology empowers and disempowers marginalized communities.
